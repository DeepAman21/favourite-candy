      <h2>Fun-Facts About Smarties</h2>
      <p>Smarties® have long been a favorite of ours! As a kid, we used them as “medicine” when we played hospitals and doctors. As a parent, I use them as a sweet reward for a job well done!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rowntree's of York, England, have been making "Chocolate Beans" since at least 1882.</li>
        <li>Rowntree's was forced to drop the words "chocolate beans" in 1937 due to trading standards requirements  so adopted the "Milk Chocolate in a Crisp Sugar Shell". Later, the sweet was rebranded as "Smarties".</li>
        <li>Smarties come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, yellow, green, purple, and pink.</li>
        <li> Over the last 25 years,[as of?] Nestlé and Rowntree's have manufactured five billion Smarties lids. Some lids are very rare and are now regarded as collectors' items</li>
        <li>Smarties are also sold in the form of chocolate bars and eggs with fragments of Smarties in them, and chocolate-and-vanilla ice cream with Smarties pieces in it known as Smarties Fusion. </li>
